# Windows

## Python

We recommend installing a complete scientific python distribution.
One of these is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

Please download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (Python 3.8 version).

## Sophos

To use the `IPython` notebook on a `Windows` computer with Sophos anti-virus installed it may be necessary to open additional ports allowing communication between the notebook and its server.
The [solution](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13036197/ipython-notebook-getting-output) is:

- open your `Sophos Endpoint Security and Control Panel` from your tray or start menu
- Select `Configure > Anti-virus > Authorization` from the menu at the top
- Select the websites tab
- click the `Add` button and add `127.0.0.1` and `localhost` to the `Authorized websites` list
- restart computer (or just restart the `IPython` notebook)

## Git

Install the [GitHub Desktop Client](http://windows.github.com/).
This comes with both a GUI client as well as the [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) terminal client which we will use during the course. In some instances Git Bash may need to be installed separately. In order to use conda with Git Bash follow the instructions [here](https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/setting-up-conda-in-git-bash/534473) 

You'll know it has worked when you can open a Git Bash terminal (the window should have a title that starts with MINGW32) and get the Git version by running

```bash
git --version
```

which should show that you have a [recent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git#Releases) copy of Git. If your version is more than 18 months old, please update it.

## GitHub

For the Git part of the course, you require access to GitHub. You will need to [sign up](https://github.com/join) and follow either the **GitHub Setup using the Command Line** or **GitHub Setup using the Desktop Client** instructions, below.

### GitHub Setup using the Command Line

1. [Generate an SSH key pair](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
2. [Add the public key to your GitHub account and the private key to your computer's keychain](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
3. [Test your SSH connection](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/testing-your-ssh-connection)

### GitHub Setup using the Desktop Client

1. Signing in to the GitHub Desktop Client should automatically set-up [SSH based authentication](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys#platform-windows) for the terminal client
2. Configure the default terminal client (there are three different flavours of terminal on Windows: `Windows CMD` (DOS like), `Windows Powershell`, and `BASH`) to use BASH, as this most closely resembles the `Linux` and `macOS` terminal used by other students:
    1. In the Desktop Client, select **Tools**
    2. Then **Options**
    3. **Default Shell**
    4. **Git Bash**

## Editor

Unless you already use a specific editor which you are comfortable with we recommend using one of the following:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io)
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com)
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)
- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

Using any of these to edit text files including code should be straight forward.
`Visual Studio Code` has integrations with [Git Bash](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal) and the [Python prompt](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial) that you may want to configure.

## Testing your install

Check this works by opening the Github shell.
Once you have a terminal open, type

```bash
which code
```

which should produce readout similar to `/c/Program Files (x86)/Code/Code.exe`

Also verify that typing:

```bash
code
```

opens the editor and then close it again.

Also test that

```bash
which git
```

produces some output like `/bin/git`.
The `which` command is used to figure out where a given program is located on disk.

## Telling Git about your editor

Now we need to update the default editor used by `Git`.

```bash
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

Note that it is not obvious how to copy and paste text in a `Windows` terminal including `Git Bash`.
Copy and paste can be found by right clicking on the top bar of the window and selecting the commands from the drop down menu (in a sub menu). Alternatively the keyboard shortcuts are ctrl+insert for copy and shift+insert for paste. 

## Testing Python

Confirm that the `Python` installation has worked by typing:

```bash
python -V
```

Which should result in details of your installed `Python` version.
This should print the installed version of the `Python` and `Git` confirming that both are installed at working correctly.
You should now have a working version of `Git`, `Python`, and your chosen editor, all accessible from your shell.
